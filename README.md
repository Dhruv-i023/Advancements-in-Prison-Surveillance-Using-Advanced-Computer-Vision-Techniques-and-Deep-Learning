# Advancements-in-Prison-Surveillance-Using-Advanced-Computer-Vision-Techniques-and-Deep-Learning
Prison surveillance systems are essential to ensure the safety of inmates, staff and visitors in medical facilities. How- ever, traditional monitoring systems often encounter problems in monitoring work quality and detecting security threats in a timely manner. To solve this problem, we propose an integrated surveil- lance system that combines the most advanced technologies for monitoring the environment and threats. This study includes the features of two different approaches: Approach 1, which includes fire detection, weapon detection and people counting functions; Approach 2 focuses on the integration of human classification on the basis of uniform. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, computer vision technology and sensor networks, the system aims to improve security measures, reduce incidents of violence and trafficking, and increase overall operational efficiency in the prison. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of coanalysis in real situations, demonstrating its ability to improve safety outcomes and reduce risk in treatment plants.of thinking about ethics and any problems that might come up.
